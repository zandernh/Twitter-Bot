# Twitter-Bot
Unless you have a Twitter API account, this might not be of any interest to you since the use of the API for the functionality contained in the script is no longer free. That said, This script allows you to access your Twitter/X account data via your console/terminal. It also allows you to like tweets based on specific keywords &amp; more.

To run in console:
# python main.py
